## TK-Blockchain featuring the WegmanHash
##
## This file contains an implementation of a simple blockchain using the WegmanHash
## as the difficult-to-reverse function in the proof-of-work algorithm. It is not
## at all cryptographically secure, but that's ok because this is only intended for
## educational purposes.
##
## Heavily inspired by Daniel van Flymen's 'Learn Blockchains by Building One'
## guide on HackerNoon:
##
##    https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46

          upper bits here to make this more clear, but most callers will be
          reducing this to a much smaller range so we don't bother with a
          redundant mask.

        ##
        ## Cycles
        ## ------
        ## Note that any potential cycle formed by this algorithm sets a fundamental limit.
        ## If the sequence of proofs generated by this algorithm and the given seed proof
        ## (set, in our case, on the genesis block) has a repeating pattern, then we must
        ## presume that someone will notice it, and they will therefore be able to
        ## perform proof-of-work at zero cost.
        ##
        ## If an implementation does have cycles, the length of it could potentially be
        ## analytically calculated. At that point, the safe thing to do would presumably
        ## be to encode a max-chain length, and have the system shut down when it's
        ## reached. Does bitcoin have a proof-link like this? Is it somehow guaranteed to
        ## avoid cycles? Assuming finite data types for proofs, it seems that the cycle
        ## length must be limited? Perhaps they have a guaranteed lower bound, and it's
        ## something sufficiently massive that no one worries about it?
        ##
        ## The implementation here, for instance, can't possibly have a cycle count
        ## longer than ~4 billion blocks (2**32, to be exact) because I'm only using 32
        ## bits of the prior proof in the proof link. Presumably, we hit a repeat way
        ## faster than that for most if not all seed values.
        ##
        ## Note that this limit could clearly be improved by increasing the size of the
        ## bitmask on proofA, or eliminating it altogether. But then we'd have a limit
        ## set by the wegman_hash implementation, which expects nothing greater than a
        ## 64-bit key. I want the cycle limit to be explicit here, so I deliberately
        ## force the bitmask. Four billion blocks should be enough for our purposes.
        ##
        ## The above number-of-possible-proofA-values only gives a loose upper bound on
        ## the max cycle length. To prove that it could be *much* shorter, consider my
        ## initial implementation here:
        ##
        ##    guess = proofA + proofB
        ##
        ## This was a very bad choice. Since this is a commutative op, the cycle length
        ## was just 2. It didn't matter how complicated the hash applied to <guess>
        ## was. The first proof-of-work was solving the equation guess = seed + x
        ## for a value of x that gave us a certain magic value for <guess>. The second
        ## proof-of-work was solving guess = x + y. It is trivial to see that y=seed
        ## gives you the same value for <guess>, which is known to be a good one
        ## (although not necessarily the only good one).
        ##
        ## This is presumably why the HackerNoon guide uses a pure concat(proofA,proofB)
        ## operation. The left-shift in the implementation here creates a similar
        ## effect, although the shift-amount isn't quite high enough to make it a pure
        ## bitwise concatenation.
        ##
        ## I have no idea what the actual cycle length of the current implementation
        ## is, for any given seed value.
        ##
        ##
        ## Termination
        ## -----------
        ## Another potential problem with this sequence is that it could terminate. For
        ## any given proofA, is there guaranteed to exist a proofB? In practice, I
        ## expect cycles to be a much more relevant issue, but I don't know if I can
        ## prove that this doesn't terminate. If it's a good hash function, the lower
        ## bits should be sufficiently random and so we should be guaranteed to get the
        ## magic pattern eventually. But a hash function that accidentally set the LSB
        ## to zero or some strange interaction between the merge() and hash() functions
        ## could potentially produce this problem.
        ##

        guess = ((proofA & 0xFFFFFFFF) << 16) + proofB
        hashval = wegman_hash(guess)

        ##
        ## Validate chain
        ##
        ##  Each link in the chain is two-fold:
        ##    - full hash of prior block is stored in current block
        ##    - proof-of-work is a function of prior proof-of-work
        ##
        ##  Why do we need this double-link?
        ##
        ##    Well, proof-of-work links are clearly not sufficient by themselves because
        ##    they *only* link the proofs, so anyone could read a block, save it's proof,
        ##    update the transactions and the subsequent chain would still pass
        ##    validation.
        ##
        ##    The hash-links solve this problem, but then why do we need the
        ##    proof-of-work link? Well, I think I'm still a bit fuzzy on this but the
        ##    proof everyone's competing to find must be a function of some part of the
        ##    current head, otherwise there'd be no consensus on the problem everyone's
        ##    trying to solve, or you wouldn't have a chain, or both.
        ##
        ##    If valid_proof() was a function of all the transactions in the previous
        ##    block, as well as it's proof, could you then elminate the hash-link? Yes,
        ##    I think you could. This would effectively merge the hash-link within the
